Gameplay:
The first Menu chooses the difficulty of the game. The harder the difficulty, the less space the play character has to move around.

Once the game starts, the player character, denoted by "A", will spawn on a platform, denoted by "-".
Meteors, denoted by "O", will start falling from the top of the calculator screen in random placement, one per second.
The player character can be moved to an adjacent platform by pressing the left and right arrow keys on the calculator to avoid the meteors.
Once a meteor lands on the player character, the game is over.
